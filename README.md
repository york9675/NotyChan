## üí™ Support

When I began developing apps, my mission was simple: to create genuinely helpful tools and offer them for free. In a world saturated with paid features and ads, I aimed to build something that anyone could use without cost, simply to make life a little easier. My apps have always been ad-free, and some, like this project, are open-source. If my work can help even a small group of people become more efficient or solve a problem, it‚Äôs worth it.

However, as a student and independent developer, I‚Äôve encountered some financial challenges. The $99 annual fee for Apple‚Äôs Developer Program has become a significant hurdle. This membership is necessary to unlock key iOS features, like Time-Sensitive Notifications, and to distribute apps on the App Store. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs a cost I can‚Äôt currently afford. I‚Äôve even had to use a Hackintosh because I don‚Äôt have the resources to purchase a Mac for development.

Despite these challenges, I remain committed to keeping this app **completely free**‚Äîwith no ads or in-app purchases. But in order to make the app fully functional and accessible to iOS users, I need assistance covering the Apple Developer Account fee.
